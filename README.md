Belly Button Biodiversity Dashboard is an interactive website that displays dataset from http://robdunnlab.com/projects/belly-button-biodiversity/ which catalogs the microbes that colonize human navels.  The dataset reveals that a small handful of microbial species (also called operational taxonomic units, or OTUs, in the study) were present in more than 70% of people, while the rest were relatively rare.

User is allowed to select a subject one at a time to display data visualizations. Charts are updated once the user changes selection.

This website consists of the following Plotly charts:
1. Bar chart - displays the top 10 OTUs found of selected individual
2. Bubble chart - displays each sample demographic information
3. Gauge chart - displays the weekly washing frequency of the selected individual
